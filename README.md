# React Vite TypeScript Website

This is a website built using **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**. Vite provides fast build and hot-reload capabilities, making it an excellent choice for modern web development. TypeScript ensures type safety and enhances developer experience.

## Features

- React-based UI
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- Scalable and maintainable folder structure
- Supports modern JavaScript features and ES modules

## Technologies Used

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite** - Fast and opinionated build tool for modern web apps
- **TypeScript** - JavaScript with static type checking
- **React Router** (optional, if used) - Declarative routing for React
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager): npm comes with Node.js, but you can also install it separately.

You can verify that both are installed by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

After installing dependencies, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app in development mode and open it in your default browser. The page will automatically reload if you make edits.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder containing the optimized production build of your app.

### Preview the Production Build Locally

To preview the production build locally, run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will serve the build from the `dist` folder.

## Directory Structure

Your project should have the following structure:

## Scripts

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server with Vite.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the project for production.
- **`npm run preview`**: Preview the production build locally.

## TypeScript Configuration

Your project is set up with TypeScript by default. The TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) includes recommended settings for React projects.

You can add these scripts to your `package.json` if they're not already set up.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to contribute to the project:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add your feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`)
